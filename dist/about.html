                <p>Hi! I’m Nathan

                        I have been interested in electronics most of my life. I got my ham radio license at the age of 15. Since that time I’ve built, maintained, and repaired my own radio equipment and test equipment. I enjoy everything from vacuum tube technology to modern solid state. I’ve had my own side business for some time working as a tech repairing mainly music gear such as PA’s, guitar amps, and recording equipment. I’ve built and restored some pretty interesting test equipment which I will share in my blog. One of my biggest projects (literately) is an AM transmitter I’m currently building mostly from scratch. It’s more of an old school style broadcast transmitter than a piece of ham equipment in design (it’s got some heavy iron in it). It’s going to be a 4-400 modulated by a quad of 808’s and will take up two 3 ft racks.
                        
                        About a year ago I decided I wanted to learn programming. The first language I decided to learn was python. It’s been a fun experience and I think python is a great first language to get the basics of programming at a high level. Along the way I’ve learned some in the languages of the web (html, css, and javascript). I’ve also begun to learn C++. I want to get into developing sdr (software defined radio) software at some point which C and C++ are necessary for such development. I also have interest in machine learning.
                        
                        I enjoy using linux for all of my computer needs including my desktop and laptop. I think all the distros are beautiful operating systems and also enjoy doing as much as I can from the terminal. The linux operating system just works and allows me to not have to deal with being bothered by a zillion questions and pop ups while I’m trying to do my work. I’ve dabbled in setting up a server for my website, while I did get it up and running on a small orangepi computer board, I decided to have my website hosted because in these times it just makes sense.
                        
                        I also have a wonderful family which I love. My wife Melissa and my son Rocket. Without them I don’t think I would be where I am now. Being in a happy loving family allows me to focus and get a lot of things done that I want to accomplish, and I know I have their full support.</p>
